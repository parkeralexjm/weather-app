# weather-app

Search different locations for the current and forecasted weather.

 - Displays current information about the temperature, windspeed and cloud cover
 - Allow user to select Celcius or Farenheit units
 - Weather symbols that update to reflect the forecast description.

 Future feature ideas:
  - Use user location as the default option
  - Allow users to select a daily forecast rather than 3-hour.
